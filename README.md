## Hey Sam, why did you put this mod to GitHub?
Nice question, there's 3 reason why I repo this mod:
1. Mods are open-sourced and I think KellyOS's forks will be great.
2. Most of mods in GitHub is for Minecraft, but no one (except this one) PB95 mods in GitHub so I decided put my mod in this website.
3. I don't have [Progressbar95 Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304550/Progressbar95/). [Note: uhh... I have it, but cracked.... only for this.]

## How to install this mod?
For 64-bit users: Go to
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Progressbar 95\Resources\art\skins\!MOD```

For 32-bit users: Go to
```C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Progressbar 95\Resources\art\skins\!MOD```

Make sure that it dosen't overlap any installed Systems, if so extract them to another folder rename them and put them. If not directly extract the folders there

If you want to update without losing your progress, just rename your new mod folder into the old mod folder name that you already have it, and delete the old version

Finally, open Progressbar95, select "Mods", and select 'KellyOS'

## Who ACTUALLY is Kelly?
![Kelly-chan](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/889898536550940702/960551292852400158/unknown.png)

This is Kelly-chan, the very cute mascot of this mod.
